\begin{problem}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and $f: X \to Y$ be a map. 
Suppose that $X = X_1 \cup X_2$ is the union of two closed subsets of $X$, and that $f|_{X_1}$ and $f|_{X_2}$ are continuous.
Show that $f$ is continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Complete the proof for the proposition stating that homotopy between maps is an equivalence relation by verifying the homotopies constructed are continuous.
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
Let $f_i$ and $g_i$ be paths in $X$ such that $f_i(1) = g_i(0)$ for $i \in \{0,1\}$.
Suppose that $f_0 \simeq f_1$ and $g_0\simeq g_1$. Show that $f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1$. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Let $f,g,h$ be loops in $X$ based at $x_0$. Show that $(fg)h \simeq f(gh)$.
